To Do for the TwitterClone project:

Apps:

twitteruser
    custom user model
        display name
        username
        password
        following - many to many -- models.ManyToManyField("self", symmetrical=False)

    home page view
        locked behind @login
        shows all your tweets
        shows tweets of everyone you are following
            If your Player model looks like this:
            class Player(models.Model):
                name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
            Then, you can execute this query:
            Group.objects.filter(player__name__in=['Player1','Player2'])
            Which roughly translates to "find all groups that have players whose names match 'Player1' and 'Player2'"
        has your profile card - shows your tweet # and # following

    profile page/view
        if logged in 
            if this is not you:
                can follow/unfollow
                    use ".remove()" on user.following.remove() to unfollow, 
                    and user.following.add() to follow
        shows all tweets from them
        counts how many tweets the user has written
        counts how many accounts the user is following
        follow/unfollow button
    menu bar:
        home page
        notifications
            notification count per user - unviewed only
        tweet
        profile (see own profile page)


tweet
    tweet model
        author
        text
        creation time

    tweet detail page
    make a tweet page
    make a tweet form
        custom saving to create a notification with @ - use regex
        has a link to the author's profile page
        has a direct link to that specific tweet

notification
    notification model
        victim - foreignkey because each notification will be to one person
        tweet id - foreignkey? because each tweet can @ several people
        viewed - boolean, default False
        will need to map out the multiple foreign keys - wait for error and look up again.

    button at top that lists how many notifications (see bootstrap for tags?)
    notification page - shows all new notifications
        once shown, these notifications are marked as viewed and don't show up again.
